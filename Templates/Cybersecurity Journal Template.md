## Core Concept
-   **One-line summary:** A single-sentence description of this topic. What is it and why does it matter?
-   **Primary Purpose:** What is this things main job or function?

## Key Details / How It Works
- **Key Components/Parts:** (e.g., For a protocol: Headers, Flags. For a tool: Main commands. For a model: The layers.)
-  **Process/Flow:** How does it operate? Step-by-step or data flow.
- **Diagrams:** (You can describe a diagram here, or better yet, use Obsidian's canvas feature or add screenshot later)
     - Example: "Data flows down the OSI Model from Application to Physical, getting encapsulated with headers at each layer."

## Technical Specifications & commands
```bash
# Place relevant code, command examples, or syntax here.
# Example for SHH:
# ssh <username>@<ip_address> -p <port>
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
