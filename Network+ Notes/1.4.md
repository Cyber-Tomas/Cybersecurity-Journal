# Network Types

## Core Concept
-   **One-line summary:** These are the types of networks that are being used all around us. 
    **They are:**  Peer to Peer, Client-Server, Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Personal Area Network (PAN), Campus Area Network (CAN), NAS & SAN, MPLS, mGRE, SD-WAN.

## Peer to Peer
### Explanation 
In this network, all devices are both clients and servers so everyone is communicating to each other to gain access to the data they might need. It is a very easy way to deploy an application.
**Advantages:** Easy to deploy, Low cost
**Disadvantages:** Difficult to administer and difficult to secure.

## Client-Server
### Explanation
In this network, the responsibilities are split, we have individual clients an then a centralized server. And when clients need to access data, everyone will access the same server. There is no client to client communication.
	- *Advantages:* Performance, administration
	- *Disadvantages:* Cost, complexity
	
## LAN
### Explanation
The network in your office or in your home is a Local Area Network. The local is relative, the local means that the network is within the same building that you are working in. We use 802.11 wireless an ethernet connectivity to have high-speed communication.

## MAN
### Explanation
Companies that have different branches within the same city use MAN to communicate to those buildings. It is the network in a city, it is bigger than a LAN, and often smaller than a WAN.

## WAN
## Explanation
If you are communicating over a larger distance or larger scope than a metropolitan area you are probably using a WAN. When expanding the distance of these networks, the networks tend to become a little slower in their throughput. MPLS and point-to-point serial are some types of WAN.  
## WLAN
## Explanation
This is a specialized type of LAN, a wireless LAN, they are usually 802.11 networks. It grants mobility within a building whilst still being connected. It has a limited geographical area due to the short distances associated with 802.11. You can extend the distance by using multiple access points.

## PAN

### Explanation
This is your own private network, for example your bluetooth headset, mouse connected to your PC. Also in automobiles connecting your phone audio to your car's audio, etc.

## CAN

### Explanation
This is the mobile ground between a local area network in a building and a metropolitan area network that can connect us to somewhere that is miles away. We could  have multiple buildings within our local area on a single campus and a CAN spans through all the buildings in the Local Area. It can be run using some type of LAN technology so we would have high speed connectivity between all of the buildings. It is a connection made on a private LAN.

## NAS
### Explanation
The data that have been accessed on a network are stored  on something like a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. It has multiple drives an is able to store large amounts of data. It is a device where you can access the files at file level meaning any change made to the file as to be done to the entire file that is located on the device.

## SAN
### Explanation
This is Storage Area Network (SAN) that also stores data accessed over a network. It stores files at block-level meaning that you can change a single block of data without affecting the entire file. It is very efficient in reading and writing files.
	NB: Both NAS and SAN requires a lot of bandwith, so you probably need to have a dedicated and very fast network for these storage devices.

## MPLS 
## Explanation
There have been some types of wide area technologies like Frame Relay an ATM. And as the way we used networks changed, MultiProtocol Label Switching was created that learnt from ATM and Frame Relay for a smarter way of communication. It makes use of labels to determine how we route traffic through the WAN, and it can use any transport medium and any protocols.

## mGRE 
Multipoint Generic Router Encapsulation is used extensively for Dynamic Multipoint VPN.

## SD-WAN
Software Defined WAN, this is a WAN built for the cloud
