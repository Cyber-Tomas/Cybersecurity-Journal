# Network Topologies

## Core Concept
-   **One-line summary:** When designing, building or troubleshooting a network we will be using a network topology type that can vary depending on the tech we are using. 
-   **Primary Purpose:** What is this things main job or function?

## Types:
Star topology,  Ring Topology, Bus Topology, Mesh Topology, Hybrid Network, Wireless Network.

## Star Topology 
### Explanation
It is also referred to as a hub and spoke, where the hub is in the middle and the spokes are the endpoint devices. It is found on almost any network regardless of the size of the network. All endpoint devices are connected to a central device i.e a switch ethernet network has the ethernet switch in the middle of the star and then all of the devices run directly back to the switch.

## Ring Topology 
### Explanation
Ring topology are no longer being used in Local Area Networks(LAN) but are still being used in connecting over a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) or a Wide Area Network(WAN) extensively. That is because we can create additional redundancy using the ring topology, i.e when sending traffic in a ring topology, the traffic moves around the ring in a circle. But when a connection cuts off, the devices around the disturbed part loops the traffic back round the network, therefore it as built-in fault tolerance.

## Bus Topology
### Explanation
This is an early type network topology, with coaxical cable as the backbone, it is simple, but prone to error. One break in the cable would either segment the network into different pieces or in some cases disable the entire network as no data would be transferred across the network. But in modern automobiles we have bus network that we use extensively, they are Controller Area Network (CAN) bus they are used to connect all of the different sensors and controllers inside our automobiles to make our cars much safer to drive on the road.

## Mesh Topology
### Explanation
Another popular topology across large networks, it is a mesh between devices or a mesh between sites. We may have devices that are connected in different locations and we might want to connect them all  together, but instead of having a single connection we create multiple connections to mesh them together. Used in Wide Area Networks
### Diagram
## Hybrid Network
### Explanation
When you start combining different topologies together, we then have a hybrid network. Most networks are hybrid.

## Wireless Network
### Explanation
If you are using a wireless network we may be communicating in a number of different ways. If you are using an access point you are probably communicating over an infrastructure connection where all devices communicate through an access point. If you just have two devices but there is no access point you can use, you can connect directly from one device to another using Ad hoc networking. And if you have an Internet Of Things (IOT) device, you are probably using a mesh network.

## Review with DeepSeek 
- **Questions:** In a full mesh topology with 10 nodes, how many total physical links are required?
- **Answers:** The formula for the number of links in a fill mesh network is n(n - 1)/2, where n is the number of nodes. For 10 nodes: 10 * 9 /2 = 90/2 = 45.
